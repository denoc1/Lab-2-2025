#Student Progress Report – Credits to Graduate

**Description:** Beginning program demonstrating how to define and display variables of type `int`, `double`, and `boolean`, and perform a simple calculation.

---

## Instructions

1. **Comment Header**  
   At the top of your program, create a comment header including your **name**, **date**, and a brief **description** of your program.

2. **Define Variables**  
   Create the following variables in your program:
   - `int studentID` – set it to a made-up 6-digit number.  
   - `int creditsEarned` – set it to a reasonable number (e.g., 45).  
   - `int creditsThisSemester` – set it to a reasonable number (e.g., 15).  
   - `double gpa` – set it to a number between 0.0 and 4.0.  
   - `boolean isOnHonorRoll` – set it to `true` or `false`.  
   - `int totalCreditsRequired` – set it to a realistic graduation requirement (e.g., 120).

3. **Print Variables**  
   Print each variable with a label.

   
4. **Perform a Calculation**  
Calculate the total credits the student has after this semester and store in a new variable, `int totalCredits`

  Then calculate the number of credits left to graduate.
  Print a meaningful message showing the result.


5.  **Formatting Notes**

  - Make sure each value is clearly labeled.
  - Use spaces or line breaks for readability.
  - Use only int, double, and boolean types (no Strings for this assignment).
